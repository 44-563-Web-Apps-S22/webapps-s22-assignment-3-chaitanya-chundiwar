The sea is one of the most beautiful blessings for human,
<b>which shows the greatness of the Creator.</b> Words canâ€™t describe the taste of that thing, who likes everyone. near it has beautiful beach.
The beach is my favorite place. <b>Sit down to relax and think.</b> I also go to it to practice many activities and games.
I join my friends in playing treasure hunt in the sand, which is based on hiding various objects down the sand and writing instructions on paper cards to help others reach them.

        What is String-Hashing? String hashing is the way to <br>
        convert a string into an integer known as a hash of that string.An ideal hashing is the one in which there are minimum chances of collision <br>
        (i.e 2 different strings having the same hash).
